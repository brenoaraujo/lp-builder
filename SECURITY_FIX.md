# üö® URGENT SECURITY FIX - Supabase Service Role JWT Exposed

## What Happened
A Supabase Service Role JWT was hardcoded in `supabase/functions/notion-sync/index.ts` and exposed in your Git repository. This is a **CRITICAL** security vulnerability.

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed
1. **Removed the hardcoded JWT** from the code
2. **Added proper environment variable handling** with validation
3. **Updated .gitignore** to prevent future secret exposure
4. **Added comprehensive security patterns** to .gitignore

## üîÑ What You Need To Do IMMEDIATELY

### 1. Rotate the Exposed Secret
The exposed JWT is: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imt2dG91b2lnY2tuZ2FsZnZ6bXNwIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1OTMyNzc5NywiZXhwIjoyMDc0OTAzNzk3fQ.utMz331bJbahS-tu4_L7EBa4Bq4_F-7yIoGH7EDF6k4`

**You MUST:**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API
3. **Regenerate the service role key** (this will invalidate the exposed one)
4. Update your environment variables with the new key

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Make sure your Supabase Edge Function has these environment variables set:
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (the new rotated key)
- `NOTION_TOKEN`
- `NOTION_DB_ID`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

### 3. Commit and Push the Fix
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "SECURITY: Remove exposed Supabase Service Role JWT and add proper env handling"
git push
```

### 4. Verify the Fix
- Check that the hardcoded JWT is no longer in your code
- Ensure your Supabase Edge Function works with the new environment variables
- Test the Notion sync functionality

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures Added

1. **Enhanced .gitignore** with patterns to catch:
   - `**/*secret*`
   - `**/*key*`
   - `**/*token*`
   - `**/*jwt*`
   - `**/*credential*`

2. **Environment variable validation** in the code
3. **Proper error handling** for missing secrets

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The exposed JWT has been in your repository since October 21st, 2025
- Anyone with access to your repository could have seen this secret
- The JWT has service role permissions (full database access)
- **You should audit your Supabase logs** for any suspicious activity

## üîç Next Steps for Security

1. **Audit your Supabase logs** for unauthorized access
2. **Review all other files** for hardcoded secrets
3. **Set up secret scanning** in your CI/CD pipeline
4. **Consider using a secrets management service** for production
